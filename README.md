# EzLandingPageBlockSpotifyBundle
Adds 2 new blocks to the Landing Page functionality of eZ Studio. 

## Blocks
> **Play Button**  
> Used for embeding music player based on selected track, album or playlist

> **Follow Button**  
> Used for embeding follow widget to allow your visitors follow the artist or user on Spotify
  
Both widgets accept Spotify identifiers, which is preferred method as it explicitly defines the resource. It also supports finding albums, artists and tracks by name but it'll return most popular one if there are multiple results for given name.

## Warning
Current release isn't stable and doesn't provide unit tests. It isn't meant for production use yet.
